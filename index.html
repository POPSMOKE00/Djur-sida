        <h2>A summary about the Arabian eagle
            <h2>
    </div>
    <h3>The Arabian eagle is a type of bird of prey that is famous for its impressive hunting skills and its striking
        appearance. More specifically, the Arabian eagle is known for its ability to soar at great heights and to spot
        its prey from a distance with its keen eyesight. Once it has identified its target, the eagle can swoop down at
        tremendous speeds and grab its prey with its powerful talons. This makes the Arabian eagle a fearsome predator
        in its natural habitat, and it is often revered in Middle Eastern culture as a symbol of strength and power.
